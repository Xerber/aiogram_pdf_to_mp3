# aiogram_pdf_to_mp3
An elementary bot on aiogram that takes a pdf file as input and converts it to mp3 for listening. For conversion, the file is saved to the bot's current directory and deleted after being sent to the user.
You can see the performance in the @sf_pdftomp3_bot (the server is a test, so the conversion takes some time)

If you want to run my parser, you will need to install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and write your bot_token to the config.ini
